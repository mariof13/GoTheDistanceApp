Go The Distance!

Video: https://youtu.be/woqCu2xKz98

Project Description:

This app is called a tip calculator, but I can assure you, this is no ordinary tip calculator. Not even an advanced tip calculator. Even more.

This app is a new fitness app that allows users to track their running time, distance, speed, and personal records in real time. The app allows for user preferences to be set and saved with a simple to use interface. The app connects to a global leader board and allows for users to compare themselves to their friends. Also, the app will email you your access code upon registration.
